- Once installed, you need to go to the <code>settings.json</code> file to change your region corresponding to your Valorant account and you can change the language to display the overlay information and then save. The regions and languages available are as follows:

- You can run the executable in the folder.

- You can go to the following address to see if you have access to your overlay: http://localhost:3000 (You must run before Valorant or the Riot Client)

- Now we will add the overlay to the stream (Streamlabs, OBS, Twitch Studio etc.)

  - You go to your broadcast software.
  - You add a new source to your scene of type "Browser Source".
  - Then you put the url localhost in the url of the "Browser Source" : http://localhost:3000
  - Put the dimensions 1920x1080.

**Information :**

Every 4 minutes the overlay will change the way it is displayed, every 4 minutes it will only display the rank.
If the overlay does not find your account, it will default to Soracle#Anemy's profile, until it finds your profile. (You must be logged into the Riot Client and have it running at least for it to find you).

**Fonctionnalit√©s :**

- Display the rank and some data of your account connected to Valorant, if you change your account the overlay will take into account the information automatically. The data displayed on the overlay :

  - The rank
  - The level of the account
  - The elo of the account
  - The number of games won this act.

- During the agent selection phase, the selected agent will be displayed on the overlay with the following data:
  - The selected agent.
  - The agent's role
  - The agent's description

Other features will arrive little by little, I invite you to see if updates of the overlay are available to take advantage of new features in the future.
